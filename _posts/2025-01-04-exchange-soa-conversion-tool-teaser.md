Many organizations still keep an on-prem Exchange server only for recipient management, even though all mailboxes are already in Exchange Online.

I've been working on a small tool that helps change exactly that.

The goal is to enable a clean transition to cloud-managed Exchange attributes, reduce on-prem dependencies, and simplify day-to-day mailbox administration.

It has also been a great learning experience for me, digging deeper into how Microsoft is evolving Exchange management in a cloud-only direction.

## Key Benefits

- **Less legacy** - Move away from on-premises infrastructure dependencies
- **Better security posture** - Cloud-native management with modern security controls
- **Cleaner architecture** - Simplified administration without hybrid complexity

More to come. . .
